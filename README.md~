In your terminal, type:
javac ImageDN.java
javac Driver.java

You will be prompted for certain items:
-Filter name (scale,border,mood,blackwhite,glass)
-Filename (including extension) that you would like to filter
As well as specifics for each filter:
-Scale: x,y value you would like to scale to
-Border: check the folder for choices, colors: black,white,red,green,blue
-Mood: happy/sad/mad
-Black & White: nothing
-Glass: nothing
And finally:
-Output filename (without extension)
-Output extension

Once you finish, a success message will print and your output file should be in the folder.

==========FEATURES==========
